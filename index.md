Miha E. Habič is a mathematician interested in set theory, primarily forcing, large cardinals, and connections to computability theory. I also enjoy thinking about other topics in mathematical logic.

I am currently a postdoc at the Czech Technical University in Prague and at Charles University. At Charles University I have mainly worked with [Jonathan Verner](http://jonathan.temno.eu/).

I completed my PhD in Mathematics with [Joel David Hamkins](http://jdh.hamkins.org/) at the Graduate Center, CUNY, in 2017.

Here is my [CV]({{site.url}}/assets/cv.pdf).

Here you can track my (meager) contributions to MathOverflow and MathStackexchange:

Every so often, I write a rambling post about a topic I've been thinking about recently. You can navigate to the posts above, but here is a list of the latest few:
